###Algorithm definition:
    * step by step procedure
    * language independent
### From data structure point:
    * search
    * sort
    * insert 
    * update
    * delete
###Algorithm characteristics:
    * unambiguous
    * have input
    * have output
    * finiteness
    * fasibility
    * language independent

Algorithm is problem and resource dependent
Program constructs can be used to write algorithms (if,for ...)
Problem has many solutions
###Algorithm analysis(efficienty)
    * priori (theorethical)
    * posteriory (empirical)
###Algorithm comlexity
    * time
    * space (memory)
###Time
    * run in constant time (independent of input size)
    * linear time (execution proportional to input size)
    * logarithmic time 
        * each step is divides by constant
        * constant is not important (smaller constant, more steps)
        * on each iteration elements are thrown (divided by constant)
        * breaking problems info smaller units (divide and conquer)
    * quadratic time (execution proportional to squeare of input size)

###Asymtotic analysis (running time)
    * best case (minimum time)
    * average cas (average time)
    * worst case (maximum time)
###Asymtotic notation
    * O notation (worst case)
    * Ω notation (best case)
    * θ notation (both cases)
###PROGRAMMING CONSTRUCTIONS
*sequence
*decision
*loops
*recursion?
